# Meet the Mighty Fines

Formed in the fall of 2019, Brandywine and the Mighty Fines are a lively five piece bluegrass band out of Boulder, Colorado, made up of Brandy Ray (mandolin, vocals), Joshua Ray (guitar, vocals), Matthew Schexnyder (guitar, vocals), Emerson Lamm (banjo), and Lena Dow (bass, vocals). 

The story of the Mighty Fines began when Josh bought his wife, Brandy, a mandolin for their anniversary. While playing and performing together at jams and ensemble classes in the Boulder area, Brandy and Joshua met Matthew, Lena, and Emerson. Through a common love of classic bluegrass and country music and pickin’ on porches, the Mighty Fines were formed. Brandywine and the Mighty Fines bring an enthusiastic approach to their music, playing both original songs and traditional bluegrass, honky tonk, and Americana tunes.

## Brandy Ray ~ Mandolin / Vocals

Singer, songwriter, and mandolinist, Brandy Ray, grew up hearing old country and roots music in her home state of Oklahoma, but it wasn’t until hearing Yonder Mountain String Band in 2003, that she realized bluegrass could be such a boot stomping good time. You can find her listening to a wide range of music. Some of her favorite artists include Tom Petty, Dolly Parton, Doc Watson, and The Kinks. She loves playing music because it makes people happy.

## Emerson Lamm ~ Banjo

Emerson’s journey into the world of bluegrass began after taking inspiration from The Infamous Stringdusters and Yonder Mountain String Band. The trading of solos, and each musician demonstrating their skill was what got him hooked, especially when the banjo kicked off. On repeat on his playlists are a mix of traditional bluegrass, jamgrass, and just about every song that was ever featured on a Tony Hawk game.    

## Joshua Ray ~ Guitar / Vocals

After diving into guitar at the age of 13, Joshua developed a broad interest in music from indie rock to ska and jazz. Now focused on bluegrass flat picking and traditional and old time music, he is influenced by artists such as Doc Watson, John Hartford, and Bryan Sutton. Joshua is also the resident brewer, gaining inspiration for recipes from traditional bluegrass and country lyrics. When he’s not pickin', he’s probably brewing at the Shady Grove homestead while listening to the Grateful Dead.

## Lena Dow ~ Upright Bass / Vocals

Lena’s musical journey began as a kid playing the violin and the piano, but after learning to play the bass, she knew that instrument would be her soul mate. Lena found musical influence from her mom’s love of folk singers like Carole King and Joni Mitchell and her dad’s love of Bob Dylan, Etta James, blues, and old time bluegrass. For her, the best part of bluegrass is getting to jam with others!

## Matthew Schexnyder ~ Guitar / Vocals

After borrowing a guitar from a kid down the street and reading Guitar World magazines, Matthew taught himself to play the guitar at the age of 16. With an electric guitar background, Matthew branched into acoustic music, drawn to bluegrass by the rich landscape of tradition, reinvention, and stories behind each of the songs. Matthew cites The Grateful Dead, Del McCoury, Led Zepplin, Willie Nelson, and Radiohead as some of his biggest influences.
