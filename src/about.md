# Meet the Mighty Fines

The mighty fines met playing at various jams around Boulder, CO and ensemble groups at Harmony Music House. We formed officially in 2019 with a shared love of classic Country, Bluegrass and Honky Tonk tunes.

After diving into music at the age of 13 Joshua has a broad history of interests across many genres of music from Indie Rock to Ska to Jazz. Now focused on Bluegrass flat picking and traditional and old time music he joins his lovely wife Brandy to bring fun tunes to the front range and beyond.
